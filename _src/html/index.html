              <p>Managing a fleet of construction equipment is the single biggest headache for site managers, general contractors and foremen in the industry. Down equipment, unused equipment and poorly managed fleets account for 30% profit loss in all construction jobs. For them, technology can’t be a major investment or risk, it must be an advantage that fits seamlessly into their daily lives.</p>

              <p>As the world’s largest construction equipment rental company, United Rentals was already leveraging an abundance of equipment telematics data to monitor their fleets. So we put brains to work for brawn. In an industry used to handshakes, fax machines and brute force, we put all our data into a tool that people use everyday and transformed an analog fleet management workflow into a streamlined, data-fueled, digital choreography.</p>

              <p>We made it easy to Rent, Track, Service, and Control massive equipment fleets, enabling an industry with razor thin margins to be more efficient and cost effective. We didn’t simply create an app, we designed an innovative, transformative brand asset that gave construction workers the power of control. By making data the most powerful tool on the tool belt, we enabled an industry to move tons of equipment with their fingertips.</p>
